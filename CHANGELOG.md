# Changelog

Release notes for earlier versions are on the GitHub releases page of
tetrixdev/laravel-ai-bridge. This file starts with 0.16.0-RC1.

## [0.16.1] — 2026-10-02

### Fixed

- **A turn running for more than an hour stopped taking messages.** The Redis stream store
  renewed only a turn's event log as events came in. Its status and metadata kept the lifetime
  they got when the turn started (`ttl_streaming`, an hour by default), so a long turn (a helper
  working on) read as `not_found` while it was still writing events, and `inputOpen()` refused
  every message typed for it. In the chat, "Send now" said the reply was not taking messages
  while the assistant was free. Each event now renews the status and metadata too, while the
  turn is streaming. A turn that goes quiet still expires `ttl_streaming` after its last event,
  and an event after the end does not stretch a finished turn.

No migration, no config change.

## [0.16.0] — 2026-09-30

The final release of 0.16.0, identical in code to 0.16.0-RC1. It pairs with **zeroplex/ai 9.4.0**
and **ai-bridge 0.17.0 or newer** (0.21.0 recommended). Published from the ZeroPlexBV fork while the
changes wait to go upstream. Everything listed under 0.16.0-RC1 below applies; run the migration
(one new column) when upgrading from 0.15.0.

## [0.16.0-RC1] — 2026-09-29

A release candidate, published from the ZeroPlexBV fork while it waits to go upstream.
It catches the package up with **ai-bridge 0.21.0** and carries everything the chat overhaul
in zeroplex/ai 9.4 needs. Everything is additive: an application that asks for none of it
behaves as on 0.15.0. Run the migration (one new column).

### Added

- **Helpers are visible.** A helper assistant's frames carry `parent_tool_use_id`, a `task`
  event reports each helper's life (started, progress, finished), and `done` carries the
  turn's helper totals (`subagent_stats`). A helper's own prose is no longer stored as the
  main assistant's reply.
- **A message can reach a turn that is still running.** `options.accepts_input`, the
  bridge's `input_open`, a new internal route `POST /api/request/input`,
  `AiBridge::sendTurnInput()` / `inputOpen()`, and `user_input` / `main_state` stream events.
  Messages the assistant never read come back (`pending_inputs`, `TurnInputsReturned`) on a
  stop, an error, or after a dropped connection.
- **Files stream to and from the machine** (bridge 0.18+), through the serve process with
  backpressure and nothing stored on the server: `Transfers\MachineFiles::upload()` /
  `open()` / `download()`, `TransferRefused` with an HTTP status and a reason.
  `AI_BRIDGE_HANDED_BACK=device` keeps files the assistant hands over on the machine.
  See `docs/file-transfers.md`.
- **What a machine says about itself is kept.** Its bridge version, attachment limits and
  capabilities from `hello`, on `/api/status`, cached in the new
  `ai_bridge_connections.last_bridge` column (so an application can say a machine is behind
  while it is switched off), and through `ConnectionStatus::for()`, `bridgeVersion()`,
  `supports()`.
- **`bridge_prompt`** option (default / off / append / replace), sent on both paths and kept
  when a lost session is re-issued. `turn_ending` is passed through.
- **Usage rate limits are told apart**: a bridge's `rate_limited` reason and `retry_after`
  reach `AiBridge::usage()`.

### Fixed

- **A conversation's "turn running" marker ends with its turn**, on every ending: a serve
  process that shuts down ends its relayed turns (`server_restarting`) and tells the machines
  to stop them; an ending from the machine for a turn nobody here knows still ends it
  (`relay_lost`); and `ai-bridge:sweep-turn-markers`, scheduled every five minutes, clears
  markers left behind. Before, a restart mid-turn left the chat looking busy for ever.
- The unread messages a bridge names when it answers a stop that this side already ended are
  recorded, not dropped.
- The test suite lifts PHP's memory limit; the full run outgrew 128 MB (already on 0.15.0).

### New configuration

| Env | Default | What |
|---|---|---|
| `AI_BRIDGE_TURN_INPUT_TIMEOUT` | `5` | Seconds to wait for a machine to take a message into a running turn. |
| `AI_BRIDGE_TRANSFER_URL` | | The address machines use for file transfers, when it differs from the public WebSocket URL. |
| `AI_BRIDGE_HANDED_BACK` | `server` | `device` keeps handed-over files on the machine. |
| `AI_BRIDGE_SWEEP_TURN_MARKERS` | `true` | Schedule the marker sweep. |
| `AI_BRIDGE_TURN_MARKER_GRACE` | `600` | Seconds before a marker without a turn buffer is cleared. |

### Upgrading

Run `php artisan migrate` (`last_bridge`). If the serve process sits behind proxy-nginx,
read the note in the docs on 502/503 interception and response buffering. File transfers
need the web server to pass large request bodies through unbuffered with long timeouts.
