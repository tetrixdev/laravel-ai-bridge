        | Controls how much the local CLI environment is allowed to influence
        | behaviour. The value is forwarded as `cli_isolation` in the welcome

        | set:
        |
        |   isolated  (default, safe)
        |     - Server-declared tools are reached through the bridge's local
        |       MCP server only. The CLI's built-in shell / edit / web tools
        |       require approval and have no interactive approver in headless
        |       mode, so the model effectively cannot use them.
        |     - Claude runs with `--bare`: no hooks, no auto-memory, no
        |       keychain reads, no CLAUDE.md auto-discovery, no plugin sync.
        |     - Other MCP servers configured on the operator's machine are
        |       ignored (`--strict-mcp-config` for Claude; equivalents where
        |       supported).
        |     - When the server doesn't send a `system_prompt`, the bridge
        |       injects a neutral fallback so the CLI's built-in default never
        |       seeps through.
        |     - Residual leak surface: user-level ~/.codex/AGENTS.md and
        |       ~/.gemini/GEMINI.md (and Codex/Gemini skills) still load —
        |       closing that requires CODEX_HOME / GEMINI_HOME redirection
        |       with auth symlinking (Layer B; see the ai-bridge repo).
        |     - Use this for any deployment where end users send chat messages
        |       to the bridge (e.g. DungeonMeister players).
        |
        |   native  (legacy, unsafe with untrusted input)
        |     - The bridge ALSO passes the CLI-specific bypass flags
        |       (`bypassPermissions` / `danger-full-access` / `--yolo`), and
        |       leaves the CLI's full local environment intact: user CLAUDE.md
        |       / AGENTS.md / GEMINI.md, skills, hooks, configured MCP
        |       servers, plugins, and the CLI's default system prompt all
        |       load normally.
        |     - Only appropriate when the bridge operator IS the user (e.g.
        |       a developer running the bridge against their own repo). A
        |       chat message from a third party in this mode can drive an
        |       autonomous coding agent across the operator's disk.
