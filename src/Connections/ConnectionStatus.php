/**
 * Live status for an AI connection — whether it is currently usable and the providers it
 * offers — resolved authoritatively rather than from cached state.
 *
 * The bridge WebSocket server holds the real connection registry in memory (a PHP-FPM
 * worker can't see it), so for a **bridge** connection this queries the server's internal
 * `/api/status` endpoint (with a short-lived relay token) and write-through-refreshes the
 * connection's cached `last_providers` / `last_connected_at`. A **BYOK** connection is
 * always usable (it carries a key); its providers come from the chat-completions config.
 *
 * This is the public, reusable form of the logic the connections API uses internally —
 * call it from app code that needs to know if a connection is live (e.g. gating a feature
 * on an available provider) without re-deriving the relay-token + endpoint plumbing.
