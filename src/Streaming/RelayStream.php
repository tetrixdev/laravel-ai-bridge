/**
 * Serve-side counterpart of BridgeStream for relayed (PHP-FPM) requests.
 *
 * When a request originates under PHP-FPM, BridgeStream relays it to the
 * bridge server's internal HTTP API. The actual AI response events then
 * arrive asynchronously at the separate `ai-bridge:serve` process — never
 * at the PHP-FPM worker that issued the request. The web worker's
 * BufferingSink and ConversationRecorder live in the dead PHP-FPM worker
 * and therefore never see those events.
 *
 * RelayStream bridges that gap. The serve process registers a RelayStream as
 * the pending request for each relayed request_id and attaches a parallel
 * {@see BufferingSink} (so events land in the per-turn event buffer for the
 * browser's SSE tail) and {@see ConversationRecorder} (so the assistant row
 * is persisted at terminal).
 *
 * Unlike BridgeStream, RelayStream does not drive the stream — the remote
 * bridge already received the ai_request. start() and cancel() are no-ops.
