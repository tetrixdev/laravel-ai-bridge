/**
 * Where a message sent into a running turn landed.
 *
 * Returned by {@see \Tetrix\AiBridge\AiBridgeManager::sendTurnInput()}.
 *
 * `accepted` means the bridge wrote the message to the CLI's input. It does NOT mean the
 * assistant has read it: a `user_input` stream event carrying the same message id says when
 * it did, and nothing promises the assistant changes course because of it.
 *
 * A rejection's `reason`:
 *  - `turn_not_running` — no turn is running under that id any more. The message was not
 *    delivered, and the one thing to do with it is start a new turn.
 *  - `turn_ending` — the turn is still running but will take nothing more (it is being
 *    stopped, or its input was closed), and its CLI may still be writing the session. Hold
 *    the message until this request's terminal frame (done / error / cancelled), then start
 *    a new turn with it; starting one sooner would run two CLIs on one session. Bridge 0.21+.
 *  - `input_not_open` — the turn runs, but was not started with its input open (or its CLI
 *    has not started yet).
 *  - `no_answer` — the bridge did not answer in time, or went away. It may have taken the
 *    message; do not resend it as a new turn.
 *  - `not_owner` — the turn belongs to another user.
 *  - `duplicate` — the same message id is still waiting on its answer.
 *  - `invalid_request` — the content had no text in it (turn input is text only; a list of
 *    content blocks is reduced to its text blocks).
 *  - `send_failed` / `unreachable` — the frame could not be put to the bridge, or the serve
 *    process could not be reached at all.
 *  - null — the bridge refused without a reason this package knows.
 *
 * Any reason other than `turn_not_running` is best treated as "hold the message until the
 * turn ends", which is what a chat did before turn input existed.
