 * Per-turn streaming event buffer.

 * bridge; HTTP clients tail the log over SSE; resumption happens by index.
 *
 * The store survives the lifetime of the turn plus a short grace window
 * (typically 30 minutes) so a browser that loads the conversation after the
 * turn completed can still replay it. After that the entry is cleaned up.
 *
 * The contract is small on purpose — drivers may be Redis, the database,
 * an array (for tests), or anything else the application wires up via
 * {@see \Tetrix\AiBridge\Streaming\StreamStoreManager::extend()}.
